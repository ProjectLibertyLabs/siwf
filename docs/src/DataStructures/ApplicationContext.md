# Application Context

#### Schema

An application context credential MUST be a W3C Verifiable Credential document containing information about the application requesting user sign in.

The `type` array for the credential should begin with the string `"ApplicationContextCredential"`.

The `credentialSchema` field should contain an object with the following fields:

- `type`: MUST be `JsonSchema`
- `id`: MUST be the URL of the published application context credential schema. The latest version is [`https://schemas.frequencyaccess.com/ApplicationContextCredential/bciqe2bsnuaqg7zy3gqjmwha2q5h2bybvr6log2jsb5kjn2hos6irrlq.json`](https://schemas.frequencyaccess.com/ApplicationContextCredential/bciqe2bsnuaqg7zy3gqjmwha2q5h2bybvr6log2jsb5kjn2hos6irrlq.json).

The `credentialSubject` field should contain an object with the following fields:

- `id`: Your provider identifier, expressed as a DID.
- `application`: A JSON object containing the following keys:
  - `name`: A map of one or more language tags to human-readable string values. Language tags should follow [BCP-47/RFC-5646](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5646.html) (as used in the HTTP `Content-Language` header). A content language key of `"*"` indicates a wildcard or default value, as in HTTP.
  - `logo`: A map of one or more language tags (as above) to objects containing a `url` property. The URL should resolve to an image in the PNG format. The recommended image size is 250 x 100 pixels.

The credential SHOULD be signed by a trusted `issuer`.
The issuer MAY be the provider's control key, expressed in `did:key` syntax.

#### Example

This application context credential describes a hypothetical app called "My Social App".
